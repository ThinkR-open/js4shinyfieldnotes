## About this bookdown  {-}

This Bookdown is the content of an informal JavaScript training given inside ThinkR, and will probably be updated from time to time. 
It's in no way supposed to be a complete JavaScript course nor even a complete book. 
Most of the content is composed of pieces of code + comments, without complete sentences. 

Please read it with this in mind.

Also, this Bookdown is `{shiny}`-centric so it focuses on things that can be useful when building Shiny application.  

What this book covers : bascic JavaScript objects, adding JavaScript to Shiny apps, the DOM elements & DOM events, jQuery, `this` and attributes, and building custom inputs for Shiny. 

You'll find in the "Examples" section pieces of code written in real life Shiny Apps. 

The Read More part points to external resources about JavaScript and Shiny.
